## 🏗️ Architecture
The RU application follows a **client–cloud architecture**:  
1. **Flutter app** (Android/iOS) handles UI, state management, and user interactions.  
2. **Firebase Firestore** stores event data, user schedules, and participation records in real time.  
3. **Firebase Authentication** manages user sign-in with email/university accounts.  
4. **Firebase Functions** process background tasks such as notifications and event updates.  
5. **Google Maps API** provides location-based event browsing and campus navigation.  

This stack was chosen to ensure **fast development**, **real-time synchronization**, and **scalability** for growing student communities.
